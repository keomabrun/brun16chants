### What do we want to obtain from the data

* PHY layer
    * rssi variation over time (identify patterns?)
    * rssi vs distance (Pister-hack model)
    * PDR variation over time (identify patterns?)
    * link asymetry
    * rssi/pdr temp correlation
* network topology
    * network churn
* network flows
    * distribution of network load in the field
* power consumption
    * distribution of charge in the field
* latency
    * distribution of latency in the field
* end-to-end
    * reliability (per node?)
