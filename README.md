## SCOPE

Challenged networks comprise those situations where communication is desired, but traditional Internet architectures fail to provide it effectively. Such networks may be characterized by intermittent connectivity, a heterogeneous mix of nodes, frequent nodal churn, and widely varying network conditions. Examples of challenged networks include deployments in rural and remote areas, networks to support emergency response operations, inter-planetary networks, sensor and wildlife monitoring networks, underwater networks, road vehicle networks, and, more recently, networks of micro aerial vehicles. The applications of challenged networks range from time-critical communications such as for disaster relief to delay-tolerant transmission in poorly connected regions or where censorship should be counteracted. However, challenged networking has also found many applications in everyday settings, for which they were not initially conceived, such as opportunistic networking supporting data-centric communications, traffic offloading from cellular networks, mobile cloud/edge computing, opportunistic and participatory sensing, challenged IoT. The increasing availability of wireless communications in embedded devices as well as integration of technologies such as Wi-Fi direct on Android platforms and LTE’s D2D (device-to-device) communication on general purpose mobile devices, will further push the development of challenged networking solutions. Challenged networking has also chartered new directions for inter-disciplinary research, e.g., applying findings from social networks and network science.

This workshop builds on the success of the ten previous CHANTS workshops, and WDTN 2005, and aims to stimulate research on the most novel topics of challenged networking research. This year’s edition encourages submission of theoretical and experimental work (including studies of real deployment), with a primary interest in the new directions of challenged networking such as mobile cloud/mobile edge computing, IoT, mobile data offloading, and challenged SDN. The workshop seeks original work presented in the form of research papers describing new research approaches and results, as well as demo submissions. Highly disruptive work-in-progress and position papers are also welcome, provided they focus on particularly innovative, out-of-the-box, solutions or applications for challenged networks. All papers shall be forward-looking, describe their relationship to existing work, and shall argue their impact and implications for ongoing or future research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

    Delay/disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs), opportunistic communication and computing
    Architecture, design, and implementation of communication systems for challenged networks
    Modeling, analysis and characterization of challenged networks and protocols
    Challenged networking techniques for mobile cloud computing
    Mobile data offloading via challenged networks
    Challenged networking techniques for participatory and opportunistic sensing.
    Challenged networking in the Internet of Things
    Big data analytics in challenged networking
    Software-defined networking in challenged environments
    Security/trust/privacy concerns and solutions in challenged networks
    Energy-efficient communication in challenged networks
    Information centric and content-centric networking in challenged networks
    Real-world mobility trace collection, analysis, and modeling for challenged environments
    Network science methods for challenged networks
    Network coding in challenged networks
    Novel challenged networking systems (e.g., networks of micro aerial vehicles)
    Real deployment and case studies in various stages of use
    Disrupted scenarios for challenged networks (e.g., disaster relief and emergency management)
    Daily use applications (e.g., mobile social networking, crowdsourcing, censorship evasion, sensor networks, IoT)
    Test and simulation tools for evaluating challenged network systems
    Configuration, management, and monitoring of challenged networks

## Paper submission guidelines

Submitted papers must be no longer than 6 pages, and should adhere to the standard ACM conference proceedings format. Demo proposals (to be published as part of the proceedings) must not be longer than 2 pages plus 1 page description of the precise setup and requirements (the 1-page setup description will not be published in the proceedings). Reviews will be single-blinded. Papers should neither have been published elsewhere nor being currently under review by another conference or journal.
